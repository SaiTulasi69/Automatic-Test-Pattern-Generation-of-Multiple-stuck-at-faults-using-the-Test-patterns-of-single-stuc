Automatic Test Pattern Generation of Multiple stuck-at faults using the Test patterns of single stuck-at faults

The fabricated circuitries are getting massive and denser with every passing year due to which a normal automatic test pattern generation technique to detect only the single stuck- at faults will overlook the multiple stuck-at faults. But generating test patterns that can detect all possible multiple stuck-at fault is practically not possible. Hence, this paper proposes a method, where multiple faults can be detected by using test vectors for detecting single stuck-at faults. Here, the patterns for detecting single faults are generated and their ability to detect multiple stuck-at faults is also analyzed. From the experimental results it was observed that, the generated vectors for single faults cover maximum number of the multiple faults and then new test vectors are generated for the undetermined faults. The generated vectors are optimized for the compact test patterns in order to reduce the test power.
